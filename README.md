# Basic Discord Bot
This is a simple discord.py bot I made for interacting with my minecraft server API.  
The bot contains a simple http request to a api for the data.

I can't say I would update this repo regularly, but as i learn more about everything, I'll try to improve it.

## Installation
You need to have Python 3+ on your system, then you can do pip install requirements.txt in the directory for the required packages. Run the bot by starting the bot.py module.
